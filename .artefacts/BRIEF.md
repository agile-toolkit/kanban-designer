# Kanban Designer — Brief

## Overview

Interactive Kanban designer: columns, WIP limits, swim lanes, template gallery with context labels. React 18, Vite, Tailwind, `@dnd-kit`, react-i18next. Deploy: GitHub Pages.

## Features

- [x] Board editor — columns, cards, WIP warnings, import/export JSON (`BoardDesigner.tsx`, `App.tsx`)
- [x] Template gallery — `templates.context.*` via `` t(`templates.context.${contextKey}`) ``
- [x] EN + ES + BE + RU — all four locales with full key coverage; `<select>` language switcher in nav
- [x] Designer strings wired — `designer.rename` (tooltip on column name), `delete_column`/`delete_card`/`delete_lane` (button titles), `no_limit` (WIP input placeholder), `column_name_placeholder` (rename input); duplicate `cards_count` removed
- [x] Card drag-and-drop — cards sortable within and between columns via `@dnd-kit` multi-container sortable; `CardItem` component with `useSortable`; vertical `SortableContext` per column; `DragOverlay` ghost; column reorder preserved
- [x] Sprint Metrics deep-link — "Send to Sprint Metrics" toolbar button encodes board column data as base64 JSON and opens `https://agile-toolkit.github.io/sprint-metrics/?kanban=<base64>` in a new tab; i18n key `designer.send_to_sprint_metrics` in all 4 locales

## localStorage keys

| Key | Written by | Shape |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| `kanban-designer:lastSession` | `App.tsx updateBoard()` (pending #10) | `{ boardName, columnCount, cardCount, boardCount, updatedAt }` |

## Backlog

<!-- Research / UX issues -->
- [x] [#2] Feature: add ES and BE locales (parity with suite) — implemented
- [x] [#3] Feature: card drag-and-drop between columns — implemented
- [ ] [#4] Integration: export board snapshot as shareable image
- [ ] [#5] Feature: card colour labels for priority and type tagging
- [x] [#6] Integration: Sprint Metrics — export per-column flow data — implemented
- [ ] [#7] Feature: shareable board URL (encode state in URL fragment)
- [ ] [#10] Integration: write kanban-designer:lastSession for Dashboard card
- [ ] [#11] Feature: swim lane rows — horizontal board striping with row assignment per card
- [ ] [#12] Feature: keyboard accessibility — Tab/arrow navigation + ARIA roles

## Tech notes

- Literal-key scans false-positive on `` t(`templates.context.${key}`) `` — do not delete those keys blindly.

## Agent Log

### 2026-05-14 — research: Dashboard key + swim lane rows + keyboard accessibility
- Done: checked all open issues — #2, #3, #6 already In Review; #4, #5, #7 still needs-review (no changes)
- Done: created issue #10 (write kanban-designer:lastSession for Dashboard card — App.tsx single-file change)
- Done: created issue #11 (swim lane rows — swimLanes already in types.ts but UI only shows tag bar, not row grid)
- Done: created issue #12 (keyboard accessibility — Tab/arrow nav, ARIA roles, card keyboard handlers)
- All three issues added to project with Backlog status
- Next task: check issues for human feedback; implement first approved item among #4 (html2canvas export), #5 (card colour labels), #7 (shareable URL), #10 (localStorage session key), #11 (swim lane rows), #12 (keyboard a11y)

### 2026-05-10 — feat: card drag-and-drop + Sprint Metrics deep-link (#3, #6)
- Done: extracted `CardItem` with `useSortable` in `ColumnCard.tsx`; added vertical `SortableContext` per column; updated `BoardDesigner.tsx` with `onDragStart`/`onDragEnd` for multi-container (column reorder + cross-column card move + intra-column card sort); added `DragOverlay` ghost; switched collision detection to `closestCorners`
- Done: "Send to Sprint Metrics" button in toolbar — serialises column stats to JSON, base64-encodes, opens Sprint Metrics in new tab; `designer.send_to_sprint_metrics` key added to all 4 locales
- Issues #3 and #6 fully implemented; project status → In Review
- Remaining approved: none currently; all open issues are `needs-review`
- Next task: check issues for human feedback (#4 board image export, #5 card colour labels, #7 shareable URL)

### 2026-05-03 — feat: ES + BE locales (#2)
- Done: created `src/i18n/es.json` and `src/i18n/be.json` with full key coverage; registered both in `src/i18n/index.ts`; replaced EN↔RU toggle button with `<select>` cycling all four languages (EN/ES/BE/RU) in App.tsx nav
- Issue #2 fully implemented; project status → In Review
- Remaining approved: #3 (card drag-and-drop), #6 (Sprint Metrics integration)
- Next task: implement #3 (card drag-and-drop between columns using @dnd-kit multi-container sortable)

### 2026-04-27 — research: market + integration + UX opportunities (round 2)
- Done: created issues #5 (card colour labels), #6 (Sprint Metrics flow data integration), #7 (shareable board URL)
- Existing issues #2 #3 #4 still awaiting human review — no feedback yet
- Next task: check needs-review issues for human feedback (#2 ES+BE locales, #3 card drag-and-drop, #4 board image export, #5 card colour labels, #6 Sprint Metrics integration, #7 shareable URL)

### 2026-04-25 — research: market + UX + integration opportunities

- Done: created issues #2 (ES+BE locales), #3 (card drag-and-drop between columns), #4 (export board snapshot as image)
- Waiting for human review on all three
- Next task: check needs-review issues for human feedback (#2 ES+BE locales, #3 card drag-and-drop, #4 board image export)

### 2026-04-19 — feat: wire orphan designer.* i18n keys

- Done: Wired `designer.rename` as tooltip on column name span; `designer.delete_column`, `delete_card`, `delete_lane` as `title` on ✕ buttons; `designer.no_limit` as WIP limit input placeholder; `designer.column_name_placeholder` in rename input. Removed duplicate `cards_count` from en.json and ru.json.
- All BRIEF features now implemented.
- Next task: check needs-review issues for human feedback

### 2026-04-19 — docs: BRIEF template (AGENT_AUTONOMOUS)

- Done: Template migration; flagged orphan `designer.*` keys.
- Next task: For each orphan `designer.*` in `en.json`, add UI in `BoardDesigner.tsx` / `ColumnCard.tsx` or remove from `en.json` and `ru.json`.
